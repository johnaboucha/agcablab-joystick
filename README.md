# AgCabLab Joystick
> Arduino code to interface the AgCabLab software with tractor cab steering wheel and console buttons.

The AgCabLab was an interactive exhibit that engaged the public in better understanding where their food comes from. The AgCabLab was showcased at county and state fairs across North Dakota, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. There was also one installed at the North Dakota Heritage Center & Museum in Bismarck, ND.

The AgCab itself was an actual tractor cab donated by Case IH. The steering wheel and console buttons were wired up to an Arduino microcontroller and computer. The computer ran custom made software that allowed kids and adults to drive a tractor around a field and harvest crops.

## Configurations

There were different generations of tractor and combine cabs donated by Case IH. A different code base was developed for each instance.
